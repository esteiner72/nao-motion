  - Python 2.7 should be functional with the `python2` command, you may have to rename your python executable on Windows from python.exe to python2.exe
- Python SDK for all platforms located at [Aldebaran](https://aldebaran.com/en/support/kb/nao6/downloads/nao6-software-downloads/)
- SDK Installation instructions located at [docs.alderbaran](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/dev/python/install_guide.html#python-install-guide)
